# Chapter 10: Data Validation

## Problem

Data science models fail silently when input data changes unexpectedly—missing columns, wrong data types, or values outside expected ranges. Without validation, these issues surface as mysterious model failures in production. Schema-driven validation with tools like Pandera catches data quality issues early, ensuring reliable model performance.

## Setup

```bash
# From project root
uv sync --group chapter10
```

## Examples

- [chapter10_data_validation.ipynb](chapter10_data_validation.ipynb) - Interactive data validation

## Quick Start

```bash
uv run jupyter lab chapter10_data_validation.ipynb
```

## Why This Matters

Data validation prevents silent model failures, catches data drift early, and ensures reliable production machine learning systems.
