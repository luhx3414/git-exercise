# Chapter 7: Unit Testing

## Problem

Data science code often goes to production without tests, leading to silent failures when models receive unexpected data or functions break after refactoring. Without proper testing, teams discover bugs in production, waste time debugging issues that could have been caught early, and lose confidence in their ML systems.

## Examples

- [01_basic_testing/](01_basic_testing/) - Write your first tests
- [02_parametrization/](02_parametrization/) - Test multiple scenarios
- [03_fixtures/](03_fixtures/) - Share test data
- [04_edge_cases/](04_edge_cases/) - Handle boundary conditions
- [05_mocking/](05_mocking/) - Mock external dependencies
- [06_test_organization/](06_test_organization/) - Structure test suites

## Setup

```bash
uv sync --group chapter7
```

## Why This Matters

Testing catches data science bugs before production, enables confident refactoring, and builds reliable ML systems that teams can trust and maintain.
